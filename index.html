                Tupac Shakur was born in East Harlem, New York City, on June 16, 1971. He spent his early years in this
                vibrant
                neighborhood before moving to Baltimore, Maryland, and ultimately rising to fame in the West Coast
                hip-hop scene.

            <div class="div-2">
                Tupac Shakur's stepfather was Mutulu Shakur, a prominent Black activist and member of the Black Panther
                Party. Mutulu
                was a strong influence on Tupac's early life and activism, as he was actively involved in civil rights
                and social
                justice movements.
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                One of Tupac Shakur's most famous songs is "California Love," released in 1995. This iconic track, featuring Dr. Dre and
                Roger Troutman, is renowned for its catchy melody, West Coast hip-hop vibe, and memorable lyrics, making it a timeless
                anthem in the world of rap music.
